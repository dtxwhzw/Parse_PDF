The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE), a part of the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST), is a collaborative hub where industry organizations, 
government agencies, and academic institutions work together to address businesses’ most 
pressing cybersecurity challenges. Through this collaboration, the NCCoE develops modular, 
easily adaptable example cybersecurity solutions demonstrating how to apply standards and 
best practices by using commercially available technology. To learn more about the NCCoE, visit 
http://www.nccoe.nist.gov. To learn more about NIST, visit http://www.nist.gov. 
This document describes a problem that is relevant across the manufacturing sector. NCCoE 
cybersecurity experts will address this challenge through collaboration with members of the 
manufacturing sector and vendors of cybersecurity solutions. The resulting reference design will 
detail an approach that can be used by manufacturing sector organizations.

ABSTRACT 

Manufacturing organizations that rely on industrial control systems (ICS) to monitor and control 
physical processes that produce goods for public consumption are facing an increasing number 
of cyber attacks. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security reports that the manufacturing 
industry is the second most targeted industry, based on the number of reported cyber attacks 
[1]. Given how critical ICS are to operations, cyber attacks against ICS devices present a real 
threat to safety and production, which can result in damaging economic impact to a 
manufacturing organization.   
The NCCoE part of NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory, in conjunction with the NIST 
Engineering Laboratory (EL) and industry collaborators, will highlight how an organization can 
take a comprehensive approach to securing ICS within the manufacturing sector by leveraging 
the following cybersecurity capabilities: behavioral anomaly detection, security incident and 
event monitoring, ICS application whitelisting, malware detection and mitigation, change control 
management, user authentication and authorization, access control least privilege, and file-
integrity-checking mechanisms.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate an example solution that protects the integrity of data 
from destructive malware, insider threats, and unauthorized software within manufacturing 
environments that rely on ICS. The EL and the NCCoE will map the security characteristics to the 
NIST Cybersecurity Framework; the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education Framework; 
and NIST Special Publication 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information 
Systems and Organizations, and will provide standards-based security controls for 
manufacturers. Additionally, NIST will implement each of the listed capabilities in two distinct 
but related existing lab settings: a discrete-based manufacturing workcell and a process control 
system that resembles what is being used by chemical manufacturing industries. This project will 
result in a freely available NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide.

1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Purpose 

Industrial control systems (ICS) in manufacturing environments are increasingly subject to cyber 
attacks and insider threats. To enhance system security, manufacturing organizations must be 
able to detect and protect against system and information-integrity attacks. Such threats to 
system and information integrity could compromise critical manufacturing programs, decrease 
productivity, and negatively impact safety and business operations. This project will provide a 
comprehensive approach that manufacturing organizations can use to address the challenge of 
detecting and protecting against system and information-integrity attacks, which leverages the 
following cybersecurity capabilities: behavioral anomaly detection, security incident and event 
monitoring, ICS application whitelisting, malware detection and mitigation, change control 
management, user authentication and authorization, access control least privilege, and file-
integrity-checking mechanisms.  
Publication of this project description is the beginning of a process that will identify project 
collaborators as well as standards-based, commercially available, and open-source hardware 
and software components. These products will be integrated and implemented in existing 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) laboratory environments, to build open, 
standards-based, modular, end-to-end reference designs that will address the security 
challenges of system and information-integrity attacks within the manufacturing sector. The 
approach may include architectural definition, logical design, build development, security 
analysis, test and evaluation, security control mapping, and future build considerations. This 
project will result in a publicly available NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide, a detailed 
implementation guide of the practical steps needed to implement a cybersecurity reference 
design that addresses this challenge. 

Scope 

These are the objectives of this project:   
• provide a proposed approach to prevent, detect, and mitigate threats from cyber 
attacks or insider threats within discrete and process manufacturing environments 
• provide a proposed approach to detect misconfigurations and device faults 
• demonstrate how the commercially available technologies deployed in this build 
provide cybersecurity capabilities that manufacturing organizations can use to secure 
their operational technology (OT) systems  

Specifically, the results of this project will answer the following questions:  
• What capabilities are needed to prevent unwanted modifications within ICS that use 
functionality verification, system and information-integrity checking, intrusion 
detection, malicious code detection, and security alert and advisory controls 
requirements? 
• What protections are needed for detecting and controlling modifications to hardware, 
firmware, and software, and what documentation is needed to ensure ICS are protected 
against improper modifications prior to, during, and after system implementation? 
• What processes are needed to verify the identity of a user, process, or device when 
using specific credentials? 

Project Description: Protecting Information and System Integrity in Industrial Control System Environments

• What mechanisms can be used for protecting both system and data transmission 
components?  
• How can baselining of typical communication patterns assist in monitoring industrial 
controllers? 

• 

This project will address:   
• detection/prevention of unauthorized software installation  
• 
security incident and event monitoring to identify, monitor, record, and analyze security 
events and incidents within a real-time OT environment 
• whitelisting to protect computers and ICS networks from potentially harmful 
applications 
change control management tools to determine if improper changes are made to a 
product or system 
• a user authentication and authorization solution to detect authenticated but 
unauthorized use of the system 
file-integrity monitoring to validate the integrity of operating systems and application 
software files   
• behavioral and anomaly detection tools to continuously monitor the network for 
unusual events or trends 
• malware detection and mitigation of any software designed to damage a computer, 
server, or computer network 

• 

Assumptions 

A manufacturing lab infrastructure is in place at NIST that represents discrete (collaborative 
robotics system shown in Figure 4-2) and process (continuous chemical process system shown in 
Figure 5-1) manufacturing environments. Numerous commercially available off-the-shelf 
technologies exist in the market to demonstrate the example solutions. 

Challenges 

While the lab environment simulates a real-world setting, it is important to note that the lab is 
on a smaller scale than many commercial manufacturing environments. Thus it likely provides a 
limited representation of real-world manufacturing environments, especially regarding the 
number of devices being used. 

Background 

As stated in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-82 Revision 2, Guide to Industrial Control Systems 
(ICS) Security, ICS are vital to operation of the United States’ critical infrastructures, which are 
often highly interconnected and mutually dependent systems. While federal agencies also 
operate many ICS, approximately 90 percent of the nation’s critical infrastructures are privately 
owned and operated. As ICS increasingly adopt information technology (IT) to promote 
corporate business systems’ connectivity and remote access capabilities, the accompanying 
integration provides significantly less isolation for ICS from the outside world. While security 
controls have been designed to deal with security issues in typical IT systems, special 
precautions must be taken when introducing these same approaches in ICS environments. In 
some cases, new security techniques tailored to the specific ICS environment are needed.  
The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) recognizes this concern and is working 
with industry through consortia under Cooperative Research and Development Agreements 

Project Description: Protecting Information and System Integrity in Industrial Control System Environments 

2 

with technology partners from Fortune 50 market leaders to smaller companies specializing in IT 
security. The aim is to solve these challenges by developing reference designs and practical 
applications of cybersecurity technologies. This project will build upon NIST Interagency or 
Internal Report 8219, Securing Manufacturing Industrial Control Systems: Behavioral Anomaly 
Detection, by identifying additional tools to improve ICS security. 

2 SCENARIOS 

NIST conducted a two-day Roadmap for Measurement of Security Technology Impacts for 
Industrial Control Systems workshop December 4–5, 2013. The participants represented a 
balanced cross-section of ICS stakeholder groups, including manufacturers, technology 
providers, solution providers, university researchers, and government agencies. The workshop 
results served as a foundation for the manufacturing scenarios researched in the lab. The 
workshop report can be found at 
https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/el/isd/cs/NIST_ICS-Workshop-
FinalReport.pdf. 
The following scenarios describe the environments that will be used to implement the 
capabilities outlined within the project. 

Scenario 1: Implementing information-system-integrity capabilities on a discrete 
manufacturing system 

The robotics-based manufacturing workcell contains a robotic assembly system in which 
industrial robots work cooperatively to move parts through a simulated manufacturing 
operation. The robots work according to a plan that changes dynamically based on process 
feedback. The robotics-based manufacturing workcell  includes two small, industrial-grade 
robots, a supervisory programmable logic controller (PLC), and a safety PLC. Additional 
information on the robotics-based manufacturing workcell can be found at 
https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2015/NIST.IR.8089.pdf. 

Scenario 2: Implementing information-system-integrity capabilities on a process control 
system  

The process control system uses the Tennessee Eastman (TE) control problem as the continuous 
process model. The TE model is a well-known plant model used in control systems research, and 
the dynamics of the plant process are well understood. The process must be controlled—
perturbations will drive the system into an unstable state. The inherently unstable open-loop 
operation of the TE process model presents a real-world scenario in which a cyber attack could 
present a serious risk to human and environmental safety as well as to economic viability. The 
process is complex and nonlinear and has many degrees of freedom by which to control and 
disturb the dynamics of the process. Numerous simulations of the TE process have been 
developed with readily available code. Additional information on the process control system can 
be found at https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2015/NIST.IR.8089.pdf.

3 LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW 

The lab contains a shared infrastructure of networked servers, measurement tools, industrial 
robots, hardware-in-the-loop simulators, and other technologies to support the NIST 
Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile implementation on two manufacturing 
systems: a process control system (PCS) and a collaborative robotics system (CRS). The PCS and 
CRS employ real-world industrial hardware (e.g., programmable logic controllers, robot arms, 
sensors), networking devices, and industrial protocols to emulate a process and discrete 
manufacturing system, respectively. Further details on the two systems are described in  
Section 4 and Section 5. 
The network infrastructure, shown in Figure 3-1, is used for many research functions, including 
testing, deployment, and hosting of cybersecurity tools; measurement systems for network 
traffic; creation and manipulation of network traffic for inducing anomalous network activity; 
and archival storage of experiment data. A virtualization environment was implemented to 
support the numerous cybersecurity technologies and tools required for the implementation. 

Figure 3-1. Lab Network Infrastructure 

The lab network infrastructure is separated into three independent network zones: 
management zone, demilitarized zone (DMZ), and laboratory zone. The management zone 
contains hosts used to manage the numerous laboratory devices (e.g., network hardware, 
virtualization servers). The DMZ contains hosts that perform data-sharing functions between the 

Project Description: Protecting Information and System Integrity in Industrial Control System Environments 

4 

lab network and the top-level network (in this case, the NIST network). The laboratory zone 
contains the shared measurement servers and tools and a virtualization infrastructure for 
hosting cybersecurity tools.  
Attached to the laboratory zone are the local PCS and CRS networks, which operate 
independently of each other. The PCS network accesses the laboratory Local Area Network 
(LAN) by using the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol, and the CRS accesses the 
laboratory LAN by using Dynamic network address translation.  
A dedicated network packet capture server is provided for both the PCS and CRS. Packets are 
captured using two methods: packet mirroring and bump-in-the-wire network probes. Packet 
mirroring involves configuring network devices (e.g., routers, switches) to duplicate and forward 
the packet to another port. Network probes perform a similar function, but they must be 
physically connected to the network cable. In the lab, mirrored packets are aggregated into two 
streams (one containing PCS traffic and the other containing CRS traffic) by using a packet 
broker. Network traffic from the aggregator and network probes terminate at the network 
packet capture servers where they are buffered, stored, and later processed to calculate the 
metrics and key performance indicators required for experimental analysis.  

4 COLLABORATIVE ROBOTICS SYSTEM  

The CRS workcell, shown in Figure 4-1, contains two robotic arms that perform a material 
handling process called machine tending. Robotic machine tending utilizes robots to interact 
with machinery, performing physical operations that a human operator would normally perform 
(e.g., loading and unloading parts in a machine, opening and closing machine doors, and 
activating operator control panel buttons).  

Figure 4-1. The CRS workcell in standby, waiting for the operator to initiate the manufacturing 
process, with the operator control panel visible at the top of the figure 

Project Description: Protecting Information and System Integrity in Industrial Control System Environments 

5 

A human operator interfaces with the workcell through a human-machine interface (HMI) and a 
control panel external to the work area. 
The workcell was designed and constructed to be reconfigurable, allowing numerous types of 
operational methodologies, network topologies, and industrial networking protocols to be 
investigated. The two robots collaborate to transport parts through the manufacturing process, 
as a single robot cannot physically reach all four stations. Having two robots also increases 
workcell efficiency. 

Control System Operation 

Parts are transported by the robot arms through four simulated machining operations, known as 
stations. Each station is composed of a fixture for holding the part, an infrared proximity sensor 
for detecting the part, a single-board computer simulating the actions and communications of a 
typical machining center, and a liquid crystal display for displaying the operational status of the 
station. The stations communicate with the supervisory PLC over the workcell LAN. The 
supervisory PLC monitors and controls all aspects of the manufacturing process. 
Manufacturing data from the four machining stations are used by the PLC to determine what 
operations, known as jobs, the robots must perform to keep the parts moving through the 
sequential manufacturing process. The PLC also communicates with the HMI for operator 
visibility and control. 
The workcell is supported by a shared infrastructure of networked servers, measurement tools, 
and other technologies. The infrastructure is used for many research functions, including 
testing, deployment, and hosting of cybersecurity tools; measurement and packet capture 
systems for network traffic; creation and manipulation of network traffic for inducing 
anomalous network activity; and archival storage of experiment data. A virtualized server 

Project Description: Protecting Information and System Integrity in Industrial Control System Environments 

6 

infrastructure was installed to support the numerous cybersecurity technologies and tools 
required for the implementation. 

Network Architecture 

The CRS network, shown in Figure 4-2, is hierarchically architected, separating the devices 
performing supervisory functions from the devices controlling the manufacturing process. The 
workcell top-level router is a Siemens RUGGEDCOM RX1510 and provides firewall capabilities 
for rule-based allowance and restriction of network traffic. The router is connected to the 
laboratory LAN by using NAT. Layer 2 network traffic for the supervisory LAN is handled by a 
Netgear GS724T managed Ethernet switch, and network traffic for the control LAN is handled by 
a Siemens i800 managed Ethernet switch.  
The router and network switches are configured to mirror all incoming network traffic to a 
packet capture server located in the measurement rack. In-line (i.e., bump-in-the-wire) network 
probes are located at the PLC, HMI, and Station 1 to provide dedicated forwarding of all 
incoming and outgoing network traffic to the packet capture server.  
The primary industrial network protocol utilized by the manufacturing process components is 
Modbus TCP.

5 PROCESS CONTROL SYSTEM  

The PCS emulates an industrial continuous manufacturing system, a manufacturing process 
to produce or process materials continuously where the materials are constantly moving, 
chemically reacting, or undergoing mechanical or thermal treatment. Continuous manufacturing 
usually implies a 24/7 operation with infrequent maintenance shutdowns, contrasted with batch 
manufacturing. Examples of continuous manufacturing systems are chemical production, oil 
refining, natural gas processing, and wastewater treatment. 
The PCS uses the TE challenge problem, a real-world industrial chemical manufacturing process, 
as the simulation model for the chemical reaction. The system integrates the control algorithm 
developed by Ricker to control the simulated chemical reaction. With the use of widely 
deployed industrial hardware like PLCs and industrial network switches as part of the control 
loop, this system emulates a complete setup of a continuous chemical manufacturing system. 
This hardware-in-the-loop configuration allows the test bed to measure performance of the 
manufacturing system by using real-world industrial hardware, while the chemical 
manufacturing process is simulated in software.  

Control System Operation 

The PCS includes a software simulator to emulate the TE chemical-reaction process. The 
simulator is written in C code and is executed on a Windows 7-based computer. In addition, the 
system includes a PLC, a software controller implemented in MATLAB, an HMI, an Object Linking 
and Embedding for process control (OPC) Data Access (DA) server, a data historian, an 
engineering workstation, and several virtual local area network (VLAN) switches and network 
routers.  
The TE plant simulator requires a controller to provide the control loops to operate 
continuously. A decentralized controller implemented in Simulink, developed by Ricker, is used 
as the process controller. The Ricker implementation matches the plant simulator accurately, 
and the controller is a separate software process that runs on a computer separate from the 
plant simulator. 
To provide communication between the plant simulator and the controller, a hardware PLC with 
industrial network protocol capability is used. The industrial protocol is used to communicate 
between the plant simulator and the PLC. The plant simulator sends its sensor information to 
the controller, and the controller algorithm uses the sensor inputs to compute the desired 
values of the actuators and sends them back to the plant simulator. 
In the plant simulator computer, a multinode DeviceNet card was installed. DeviceNet is a 
common industrial protocol used in the automation industry to exchange data between control 
devices. The multinode card allows a single hardware device to emulate multiple virtual 
DeviceNet nodes. In our case, each sensor and actuator point is a dedicated node. Therefore, 53 
virtual nodes (41 for sensors and 12 for actuators) were configured in the system. A software 
interface was developed to send and receive sensor and actuator values between the plant 
simulator and the PLC through DeviceNet.  
An OPC DA server runs on a Windows 7 computer, acting as the main data gateway for the PLC. 
The PLC communicates to the OPC DA server to update and retrieve all the sensor and actuator 
information, respectively. This sensor and actuator information is also known in PLC terminology 
as a "tag." The controller has a MATLAB Simulink interface that communicates with the OPC DA 
server directly. 

Project Description: Protecting Information and System Integrity in Industrial Control System Environments 

9 

An HMI and a data historian are implemented in the system. The HMI provides a graphical user 
interface to present information to an operator or user about the state of the process. The data 
historian serves as the main database to record all the process sensor and actuator information. 
Both HMI and data historian have built-in interfaces to establish connections to the OPC DA to 
access all the process information. 
An engineering workstation is used in the system for engineering support, such as PLC 
development and control, HMI development and deployment, and data-historian data retrieval. 

Network Architecture 

The PCS network is segmented from the main laboratory LAN by a boundary router. The router 
uses a dynamic routing protocol, OSPF, to communicate with the main top-level router. The 
network architecture is shown in Figure 5-1. 
All network traffic needs to go through the boundary router to access the main laboratory LAN. 
There are two virtual network segments in the system. Each network is managed by an Ethernet 
switch. The HMI and the controller are in VLAN-1, while the plant simulator, data historian, OPC 
DA server, and PLC are in VLAN-2. 
VLAN-1 simulates a central control-room environment where the HMI and the controllers are 
virtually located in the same network segment. VLAN-2 simulates the process operation 
environment, which typically consists of the operating plant, PLCs, OPC server, and data 
historian.
